# Pancake Sort

There is an abstract data type (ADT) called a *pancake array*, which provides
the function `flip(array, n)`, which takes the top (first) $n$ items in the
array and "flips them over", i.e. reverses their order.

For example, if you called `flip([1, 2, 3, 4], 2)`, the result would
be the array  `[2, 1, 3, 4]`, because the order of the (first) top 2
elements in the array has been reversed.

If $n$ is larger than the number of items in the array, the entire array gets
reversed. The intuition for the name "pancake array" is that with a stack of
pancakes, you can insert a spatula at any point in the stack and use it to flip
over all pancakes above that point.

Implement a sorting function that will sort an array of pancakes such that the
smallest pancake is at the top. You may use only the `flip()` function to
manipulate the array. You may break ties arbitrarily. Test your new function;
I've provided some basic testing code that uses
[jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in `code.test.js`, but it only tests
`pancakeSort()`, not `flip()`.

Hint: Start by thinking about the calls to `flip()` required to move a *single*
element into its correct position.

RESOURCES: Coded in python and used ai to convert to js below is my code

import random

def flip(arr, i):

start = 0

while start < i:

(arr[i], arr[start]) = (arr[start], arr[i])

start += 1

i -= 1

def pancakeSort(arr, n):

curr_size = n

while curr_size > 1:

large = 0

for i in range(1, curr_size):

if arr[i] > arr[large]:

large = i

if large != curr_size - 1:

flip(arr, large)

flip(arr, curr_size - 1)

curr_size -= 1

return arr

array = [random.randint(-10, 10) for _ in range(5)]

print(array)

new_array = pancakeSort(array, len(array))

print(new_array)



## Runtime Analysis

What is the asymptotic runtime ($\Theta$) of your algorithm in terms of the
number of comparisons? What is it in terms of the number of flips? Add your
answer to this markdown file.

The asymptotic runtime of the pancake sort algorithm, in terms of both comparisons and flips, is Î˜(n^2)
